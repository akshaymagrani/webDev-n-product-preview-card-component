### Process:
  1. after coding - treat all content as blocks to be manipulated.
    e.g. block 1 - image div | block 2 - content div
  2. after coding - create utilities/ use utilities.
    e.g. create simple text, color, bg-color based classes for use in project.
  
  What I learnt - 
  1. utilities are my friend to time saving. Have a general file of them ready for inclusion in projects to be manipulated as required.

  This is where bootstrap and other framework shines.

  1. I coded to match the desktop view using - 
  
```
main{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
  to align the content in the center of the screen instead of the margin: auto.
